    <h1>Terminology & Definitions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Name the three ways to declare a variable?
        <p>var, let, const</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
        <p>
          We shouldn't give short names like a,b,c. <br />
          For the constants we shouldn't name the variables as codes of color.
          <br />
          We shouldn't chain variables like let a = b = c = 5;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What rules should you follow when naming variables?
        <p>
          -The first character must be a letter or an underscore (_). You can't
          use a number as the first character. <br />
          -The rest of the variable name can include any letter, any number, or
          the underscore. You can't use any other characters, including spaces,
          symbols, and punctuation marks. <br />
          -You can't use one of JavaScript's reserved words as a variable name
          like var, return, function, let, class
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and
        strings?
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How does the % operator work?
        <p>
          It is a modulus operator and it returns remainder of two operands. For
          example: 5 % 2 => it returns 1
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Explain the difference between == and ===.
        <p>
          They are both means equal to but === is more strict. For example: "3"
          == 3 gives us TRUE; "3" === 3 gives us FALSE
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        When would you receive a NaN result?
        <p>
          Math operation where the result is not a real number, any operation
          that involves a string.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you increment and decrement a number?
        <p>++ for incrementing by 1 and -- for decrementing by 1</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing
        increment/decrement operators.
        <p>
          With operator after operand (for example, x++), the increment operator
          increments and returns the value before incrementing. => let x=3; y=
          x++; //x=4, y=3 <br />
          With operator before operand (for example, ++x), the increment
          operator increments and returns the value after incrementing. => let a
          = 2; b= ++a; //a = 3, b= 3
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?
        <p>
          Operator precedence determines how operators are parsed concerning
          each other. Operators with higher precedence become the operands of
          operators with lower precedence. (..) has the highest precedence.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you log information to the console?
        <p>console.log()</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers?
        <p>
          The unary plus (+) operator is the fastest (and preferred) method of
          converting something into a number. +"42" //42 - +true // 1 - +[] //0
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are the eight data types in JavaScript?
        <p>Boolean, string, number, symbol, null, undefined, bigInt, objects</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Which data type is NOT primitive?
        <p>Object is a non-primitive data type.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the relationship between null and undefined?
        <p>
          let age; console.log(age) it gives undefined. It means I declare a
          variable but didn't assign any info in it. <br />
          let age = null; console.log(age); It gives us null. It means it
          doesn't have a beginning value and it makes us escape for the errors.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for
        strings?
        <p>
          In JavaScript, single quotes (‘’) and double quotes (“”) are used to
          create string literals. Backticks are mostly used for HTML or code
          embedding purposes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string?
        <p>
          Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters,
          allowing for multi-line strings, for string interpolation with
          embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged
          templates.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?
        <p>
          You'll need to use opposite quotation marks inside and outside of
          JavaScript single or double quotes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?
        <p>${}</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you escape characters in a string?
        <p>
          If you use single quotes to create a string, you can not use single
          quotes within that string without escaping them using a backslash (\).
          var name = 'I/'m Damla'.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between the slice/substring/substr string
        methods?
        <p>
          slice() extracts parts of a string and returns the extracted parts in
          a new string. substr() extracts parts of a string, beginning at the
          character at the specified position, and returns the specified number
          of characters. substring() extracts parts of a string and returns the
          extracted parts in a new string.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?
        <p>|| OR, && AND, ! NOT</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are the comparison operators?
        <p>
          Comparison operators — operators that compare values and return true
          or false . The operators include: > , < , >= , <= , === , and !== .
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are truthy and falsy values?
        <p>
          Truthy values are values that evaluate to True in a boolean context.
          Falsy values are values that evaluate to False in a boolean context
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are the falsy values in JavaScript?
        <p>
          A falsy value is something which evaluates to FALSE, for instance when
          checking a variable. There are only six falsey values in JavaScript:
          undefined , null , NaN , 0 , "" (empty string), and false of course.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are conditionals?
        <p>
          Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine
          whether or not pieces of code can run. There are multiple different
          types of conditionals in JavaScript including: “If” statements: where
          if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of
          code.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?
        <p>
          if(hour < 18) { return 'Good day'; } else { return 'Good evening'; }
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the syntax for a switch statement?
        <p>
          switch(expression) { case value1: .. break; case value2: .. break; }
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the syntax for a ternary operator?
        <p>
          The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator
          that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark
          (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed
          by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition
          is falsy => condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is nesting?
        <p>
          Nesting is when you write something inside of something else. You can
          have a function inside of another function. You can have an if
          condition inside of another if condition.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are functions useful for?
        <p>
          JavaScript provides functions similar to most of the scripting and
          programming languages. In JavaScript, a function allows you to define
          a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as
          you want.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you invoke a function?
        <p>
          We can call the function. function myFunction(a,b){return a * b;}
          myFunction(10.2);
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are anonymous functions?
        <p>
          Anonymous Function is a function that does not have any name
          associated with it. Normally we use the function keyword before the
          function name to define a function in JavaScript, however, in
          anonymous functions in JavaScript, we use only the function keyword
          without the function name
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is function scope?
        <p>
          Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is
          only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that
          function.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are return values?
        <p>
          JavaScript passes a value from a function back to the code that called
          it by using the return statement. The value to be returned is
          specified in the return. That value can be a constant value, a
          variable, or a calculation where the result of the calculation is
          returned.
        </p>
